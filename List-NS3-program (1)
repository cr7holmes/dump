1. Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
2. Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP agent between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents by changing the parameters and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP.
3. Simulate simple Extended Service Set with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.
4. Simulate a wireless network, generate traffic and analyze its performance.
5. Simulate a transmission of ping message over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
